# README Generator

## Description
    
My motivation for this project is to make it easier to develop READMEs in the future. Simply run the program and answer the questions prompted to you and the readMe file will be generated inside the folder it is located in.
    
## Table of Contents (Optional)
    
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
